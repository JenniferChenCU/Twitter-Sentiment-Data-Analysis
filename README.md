# Twitter-Sentiment-Data-Analysis

In this project, we work on sentiment140 dataset on tweets contents and our goal is to make sentiment analysis to predict whether it is a positive or negative word. We take the advantages of  natural language processing techniques to preprocess the text data and construct machine learning and deep learning models such as logistic regression, decision tree, lstm, and so on to conduct sentiment classification.
